[figure-popcount-s] shows, separately for each of the 10 zones in
the Southern hemisphere, the number of stations contributing to each
month. The gross features of this station-count graph are discussed in
[LAWRIMOREETAL2011]. Compared to the Northern hemisphere, the Southern
hemisphere has far fewer stations, and those stations are generally
established later. Data is particularly sparse in the Southernmost
zones. Zone 1 (53째S to 64째S) has no stations until the first decade of
the 1900s when Base Orcadas, WMO 88968, was established and Grytviken,
WMO 88903, was settled.  Zone 0 (64째S to 90째S) has no stations until
the 1940s when Faraday, now Vernadsky, WMO 89063, was settled and a
station identified as WMO 89062 and named Rothera starts reporting.
The station record for WMO89063 in GHCN-M deserves further attention as
Rothera Research Station was not established until 1975.

The reliance on a very small number of stations for certain
regions and decadal periods is unfortunate, but indicates the
importance of careful reconstruction and correction for even
individual stations, such as that undertaken by Bromwich et al
for Byrd station [BROMWICHETAL2012]. Bromwich's Byrd record has not
been used in ZONTEM because for simplicity only a single source,
GHCN-M, is used. I encourage the curious to perform their own
experiment, changing ZONTEM to incorporate the record into the
analysis.
