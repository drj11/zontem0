INTRODUCTION

Other workers have estimated the global temperature change.

It is common to use databases of historical temperature records
that have been made available, and the Global Historical
Climatology Network is well suited for this purpose. ZONTEM uses
GHCN-M v3 ([LAWRIMOREETAL2011]).

Temperature records from land surface stations are only one
source of data for estimating global historical temperature
change.

Since 1979 microwave sounding units have been flown on
Earth polar-orbiting weather satellites, and it is possible to
use the microwave brightnesses reported by the sensors to
estimates temperatures (and hence, temperature change) of
various layers of the atmosphere, including the lower
troposphere.  [MEARSWENTZ2009] illustrates one such approach.
Satellites give near global coverage (regions near the poles and
regions above 1500m surface elevation are typically excluded),
and give a gridded dataset, however they only have data since
1979, which is a considerably shorter period than the
instrumental record (which has hundreds of records that are
century length). 

Other workers have made use of networks of various proxies for
temperature (such as ice cores, speleotherms, corals, clay varves,
bore holes), and reconstructed temperature change for periods preceding
the instrumental period (for example [NEUKOMETAL2014] reconstructs
the period 1000 AD to present).  Such reconstructions have
limited regional resolution (typically giving estimates only for
an entire hemisphere), have limited time resolution, and have
more uncertainty than instrumental estimates, but they give
essential insight into the climate of earlier periods.
