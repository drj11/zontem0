INTRODUCTION

Changes in Earth's near surface air temperature are a key indicator of
global warming. Direct measurements from meteorological stations
been used by various workers to estimate hemispheric and global averages
of historical temperature change [CALLENDAR1938] [MITCHELL1963], and
since about 1980 such estimates have had reasonable coverage of
both hemispheres [HANSENETAL1981] [PETERSONETAL1998].

Estimates from meteorological stations have the drawbacks of incomplete
spatial coverage (stations tend to be built in rich industrialised
nations, and of course, on land, which only covers about 30% of Earth's
surface), and, even in regions with a reasonable density of stations,
only being reliable as far back as standardised instrumentation
(generally considered to be about 1880). Spatial coverage is improved
with satellite measurements [MEARSWENTZ2009], and longer records can
be achieved from proxy sources [NEUKOMETAL2014], but each of these has
drawbacks of their own. Temperature series from satellites only go
back to 1979; temperature series from proxies have coverage issues,
and other uncertainties. Both suffer from a certain methodological
problems: to put it bluntly, it's easier to get a temperature reading
from a thermometer than from an orbiting microwave sensor, or mud
from the bottom of a lake. Estimates from meteorological stations
remain important.
