INTRODUCTION

Changes in Earth's near surface air temperature are a key indicator of
global warming. Direct measurements from meteorological stations
have been used by various workers to estimate hemispheric and
global averages of historical temperature change [CALLENDAR1938]
[MITCHELL1963], and since about 1980 such estimates have had reasonable
coverage of both hemispheres [HANSENETAL1981] [PETERSONETAL1998].

Estimates from meteorological stations have the drawbacks of incomplete
spatial coverage (stations tend to be built in rich industrialised
nations, and of course, on land, which only covers about 30% of Earth's
surface), and, even in regions with a reasonable density of stations,
only being reliable as far back as standardised instrumentation
(generally considered to be about 1880). Spatial coverage is improved
with satellite measurements [MEARSWENTZ2009], and longer records can
be achieved from proxy sources [NEUKOMETAL2014], but each of these has
drawbacks of their own. Temperature series from satellites only go
back to 1979; temperature series from proxies have coverage issues,
and other uncertainties. Both suffer from certain methodological
problems: to put it bluntly, it's easier to get a temperature reading
from a thermometer than from an orbiting microwave sensor, or from mud
from the bottom of a lake. Estimates from meteorological stations
remain important.

Throughout the 20th Century estimates of global temperature
change have gone through a sequence of sophistication and
elaboration. Hand calculations using networks of a
few hundred meteorological stations [CALLENDAR1938]
[MITCHELL1963] progressed to processing thousands of stations
with digital computers [HANSENETAL1981].  Estimates have been improved
further by: removing non-climatic sources of variation [HANSENETAL1999]
[MENNEWILLIAMS2009]; incorporating temperature variations from
the sea surface [HANSENETAL1996]; improving digital databases of
climate data [LAWRIMOREETAL2011]; using daily data [ROHDEETAL2013];
careful reconstruction of individual metereological station records
[BROMWICHETAL2013]; hybrid interpolation of satellite data with
sparse metereological station data [COWTANWAY2014]. These improvements
have generally reduced uncertainties [BROHANETAL2006] and produced
increasingly refined maps of temperature change.

I welcome these improvements to our collective understanding of
global historical temperature change, but I recognise that they
come at a price. Collectively they raise the barrier to
understanding how we make conclusions about global historical
temperature change.  The purpose of this study is not to create a new
more sophisticated estimate with smaller errors bars. The purpose
of this study is to show a simple method for creating a
reasonable estimate of global historical temperature change.
