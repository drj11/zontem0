[HANSENETAL2006] starts "Global temperature is a popular metric for
summarizing the state of global climate."  This is a good way of
setting the frame for why global temperature is interesting, but
seems a bit glib.

Perhaps surprisingly [JONESETAL2012] doesn't say why surface
temperature is important. It pretty much just assumes that you
already know why.

why does 14963870000 have data for 1850 and 1859 and 1864, but
doesn't really start in earnest until 1875?
