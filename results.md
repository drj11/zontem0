# RESULTS

[figure-compare] shows the annually resolved temperature change
computed by ZONTEM, and for comparison, the GISTEMP series using
only meteorological stations [HANSENLEBEDEFF1987] (the data used
are actually generated by ccc-gistemp [BARNESJONES2011], but the
method and results are identical).

Of the commonly available instrumental estimates of temperature change,
the GISTEMP meteorological station analysis is the most appropriate for
comparison for several reasons: no ocean data, zonal scheme, reference
station method. Ocean data improves coverage, but comes with
data homogenisation issues of their own [HANSENETAL1996].
For simplicity's sake ZONTEM uses only
metereological station data; a comparison with a dataset that
combines metereological station data with ocean data wouldn't be
a meaningful comparison in this context.

The zonal scheme used by GISTEMP [HANSENETAL2006] is similar to
the zonal scheme used by ZONTEM. In GISTEMP hemispheric and
global averages are computed from zonal averages weighted by the
area of the zone, which avoids giving too much weight to zones
that are well-endowed with stations. Mitchell, 1963, discusses a
similar approach, but other analyses of global temperature
change do not generally incorporate this zonal idea.

As currently configured, ZONTEM uses the Reference Station
Method [HANSENLEBEDEFF1987] to combine data from several
metereological stations. The method used to combine stations
makes a small difference to hemispheric trends [VOSEETAL2005],
but in order to eliminate this variable, the comparison is with
GISTEMP which also uses Reference Station Method.
