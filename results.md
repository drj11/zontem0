# RESULTS

[figure-compare] shows the annually resolved temperature change
computed by ZONTEM, and for comparison, the GISTEMP series using
only meteorological stations [HANSENLEBEDEFF1987] (the data used
is actually generated by ccc-gistemp [BARNESJONES2011], but the
method and results are identical).

Of the commonly available instrumental estimates of temperature change,
the GISTEMP meteorological station analysis is the most appropriate for
comparsion for several reasons: no ocean data, zonal scheme, reference
station method. Of course ocean data will give more accurate estimates
of global temperature, but for simplicity's sake ZONTEM uses only
metereological station data; a comparison with a dataset derived from
land and ocean temperatures wouldn't be sensible. As an
intermediate step, ZONTEM computes a temperature series for each
zone. Effectively, the meteorological stations in any particular
zone are assumed to be representative of the entire zone. This
is in contrast to CRUTEM4 which takes a more typical approach of
using a station's temperature series only for the grid box in
which it resides (typically 5°×5°); to makes hemispherical
averages each grid box is weighted by its area. GISTEMP employs
a similar zonal scheme to ZONTEM: when making estimates for
hemispherical regions, zonal estimates are computed, and then
each zone is weighted according to the zone's area
[HANSENETAL2001].
