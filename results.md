# RESULTS

[figure-compare] shows the annually resolved temperature change
computed by ZONTEM, and for comparison, the GISTEMP series using
only meteorological stations [HANSENLEBEDEFF1987] (the data used
is actually generated by ccc-gistemp [BARNESJONES2011], but the
method and results are identical).

Of the commonly available instrumental estimates of temperature change,
the GISTEMP meteorological station analysis is the most appropriate for
comparison for several reasons: no ocean data, zonal scheme, reference
station method. Ocean data improves coverage, but comes with
data homogenisation issues of their own [HANSENETAL1996].
For simplicity's sake ZONTEM uses only
metereological station data; a comparison with a dataset that
combines metereological station data with ocean data wouldn't be
a meaningful comparison in this context.

As an intermediate step, ZONTEM computes a temperature series for each
zone. Effectively, the meteorological stations in any particular zone
are assumed to be representative of the entire zone. This is in contrast
to CRUTEM4 which takes a more typical approach of using a station's
temperature series only for the grid box in which it resides (typically
5°×5°); to makes hemispherical averages each grid box is weighted
by its area. GISTEMP employs a similar zonal scheme [HANSENETAL2006] to
ZONTEM: when making estimates for hemispherical regions, zonal estimates
are computed, and then each zone is weighted according to the zone's
area.
